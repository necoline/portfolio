During her time at Development Seed, I worked with partners in Science, Humanitarian and Intelligence sectors to create custom geospatial data products. In her first year, I worked primarily as a frontend engineer, building tools that translated geospatial data into accessible tools to serve the practical needs of users and organized to help clients more easily scale their data base and build future products or both.

While working with partners at NASA, I discovered a love for collaborating with the subject matter experts. We needed to work closely in order to create a product that would be truely useful for the end user. During the second half of my time at Development Seed, I devoted a majority of my time specfically working with partners in the discovery and scoping stages. 

I worked on topics ranging from urban tree coverage, to fire monitoring to tools that would help NASA scientist search across varios distint databases. My proudest accomplishement was my year long collaboration on CASEI where I worked both as an engineer and product owner to help NASA scientist search sub-orbital earth scient investigation via meta-data that connected the findings across campaigns, platforms and instruments. This project later won the 2022 Silver Group Achievement Award. 

Below is a sample of projects I delivered in my time at Development Seed.
