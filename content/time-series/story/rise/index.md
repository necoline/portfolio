Prior to getting into tech, Necoline worked in refugee services. She was studying international affairs with an emphasis on refugee issues when she initially got into tech. While working at Google, she was approached by a non-profit that was looking to build a web tool for aid workers in refugee camps.

Necoline couldnâ€™t resist the opportunity to combine her technical skills with her passion for improving refugee services. As a small organization, this job required her to take on multiple roles. She worked across the stack, and participated user research in the field that was then translated into design and technical planning.

During the year long contract, I visited the refugee camps twice. Once to conduct user research and later to test the pilot in context.
