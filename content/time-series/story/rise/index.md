Prior to getting into tech, I worked in refugee services. It was while I was studying international affairs with an emphasis on refugee issues when I initially got into tech. While working at Google, I was approached by a non-profit that was looking to build a web tool for aid workers in refugee camps.

I couldnâ€™t resist the opportunity to combine my technical skills with my passion for improving refugee services. As a small organization, this job required me to take on multiple roles. I worked across the stack, and led user research in the field that was then translated into design and technical planning.

During the year long contract, I visited the refugee camps twice. Once to conduct user research and later to test the pilot in context.
