I first learned about CodeSandbox when I was looking for a way to showcase component composition to my team using a library I had just built. I later fell in love with it as the perfect solution for teaching students in refugee camps how to code. 

After a while of building small tools with Development Seed, I was hungry for a single product to live and breathe in. 

While working at CodeSandbox, I have been immersed in all aspects of product discovery, development and delivery. Some of my proudest accomplishments so far include:


1.  Leading the launch of CodeSandbox on iOS resulting in #3 on product hunt.

2.  Driving interest in Pro subscriptions through trials and marketing campaigns resulting in 15% growth in team subscriptions 20% increase in team seat count seats increased by 20%.

3. Developed user feedback channels and systems of collecting and synthesizing findings from interviews and surveys. This resulted in a steady stream of 3 interviews a week and direct feedback on active product discovery.

4. Merged the dashboard experiences for the original and beta product offerings (cloud sandboxes and repositories) zero loss in user engagement on protyping sandboxes while driving up engagement of cloud sandboxes and repositories by 120% and adoption by 106%.
