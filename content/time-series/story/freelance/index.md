Any bootcamp graduate will tell you that the path from school to a flourishing career in tech can be a long one. In Necoline's case, she was fortunate to be surrounded by mentors who were willing to give her a leg up when she needed it. After finishing a 11 week, part time bootcamp that she casually took during her graduate program, she decided take on a series of web development gigs to test out this new world of technology. She started out small but selected projects with increasing complexity at every chance she got. All the while, she pulled on the resources around her to review her work and learn how to elevate her practice.
