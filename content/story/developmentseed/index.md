At the conclusion of the RISE contract, I joined Development Seed as a frontend engineer. Here I created geospatial data products for organizations like IFRC, NASA and Microsoft. About a year into the job, I entered into the role of team lead where I facilitated improvements to our development practices and mentored team members.
