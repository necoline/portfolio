Any bootcamp graduate will tell you that the path from school to a flourishing career in tech can be a long one. In my case, I was fortunate to be surrounded by mentors who were willing to give me a leg up when I needed it. After finishing a 11 week, part time bootcamp that I casually took during my graduate program, I decided take on a series of web development gigs to test out this new world of technology. I started out small but selected projects with increasing complexity at every chance I got. All the while, pulling on the resources around me to review my work and show me how to elevate my practice.
